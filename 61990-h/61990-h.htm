<blockquote><p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span><span class="smcap">Psalm</span> cxxiv. <i>v.</i> 2. and
part of the 3<sup>d</sup>.</p>
<p><i>If it had not been the Lord who was on our side</i>,
<i>when Men rose up against Us</i>; <i>Then They had swallowed Us
up quick</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Whoever</span> compares this <i>Psalm</i>
and this <i>Solemnity</i> together, will find the main
<i>Lines</i> of the one, and the chief <i>Circumstances</i> of
the other exactly agreeable.&nbsp; Had We Who live since the
<i>Deliverance</i> of this Day was wrought, been endued with the
<i>Divine Author&rsquo;s</i> Inspiration, we could scarce have
pitch&rsquo;d upon more apposite Words to express the surprizing
<i>Manner</i> of it.&nbsp; <i>Swallowing up quick</i>, <i>the
Kindling</i> of our Enemies <i>Wrath</i>, the Torrents <i>being
like to go over our Soul</i>, our <i>Escaping like a </i><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span><i>Bird out of
the Fowler&rsquo;s Snare</i>: All these are <i>Expressions</i> so
pat for the present <i>Season</i>, that whilst We sing an
<i>Hymn</i>, we seem likewise to read a <i>Prophecy</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Our Enemies</i> have took effectual Care that the ill
<i>Character</i> in this <i>Psalm</i> should not pass
unfulfill&rsquo;d:&nbsp; And I hope we, for our parts, shall not
be wanting to make good the pious <i>Acknowledgments</i> of it,
saying, <i>Blessed be the Lord who hath not given us as a Prey to
their Teeth</i>.</p>
<p>But perhaps We are got so deep into a <i>Vein</i> of
<i>Thanksgiving</i> for <i>Modern Mercies</i>: Our <i>Streets</i>
are so full of Triumph, and our <i>Churches</i> of Praise for the
<i>Victories</i> of the past Year, that either no <i>Place</i> is
left for the Recollection of any former <i>Blessings</i>, or at
least little or no <i>Taste</i>.&nbsp; The present
<i>Solemnity</i> finds our Gratitude to such a degree exhausted,
that tho&rsquo; at the utmost &rsquo;tis but an <i>insufficient
Return</i>, yet at this <i>Juncture</i> it must needs be more so,
considering how our late <i>Successes</i> have already
drain&rsquo;d our very best <i>Acknowledgments</i>.&nbsp; Thus
the <i>Blessings</i> of one Age do a seeming Injury to
<i>Those</i> of the foregoing; And immediate <i>Deliverances</i>
bear down so <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>strongly, as to make distant ones shrink out of
<i>Notice</i>.</p>
<p><i>Happy We</i>, who have such an agreeable <i>Excuse</i> for
being <i>imperfectly</i> thankful: I mean, when <i>Modern</i>
Favours are so great, as necessarily to impair the Memory of the
<i>Antient</i>.&nbsp; Tho&rsquo; upon second Thoughts this Excuse
cannot hold, since the Favours lately <i>received</i>, and Those
at this Time <i>recollected</i>, are so much of a Piece, that
unless we break the <i>Chain</i> of <i>Providence</i>, we cannot
well pretend to <i>acknowledge</i> the one, and yet wholly to
<i>overlook</i> the other.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis the same <i>Cause</i>, the same <i>Interest</i>
this Year so gloriously <i>promoted</i>, which upon this Occasion
we congratulate, as <i>twice</i> wonderfully
<i>preserved</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Reign</i> of our <i>gracious
Sovereign</i> directly perpetuates the double <i>Blessing</i>
which this <i>Day</i> boasts of; And (God be praised) We obey a
good <i>Queen</i>, who nobly maintains the <i>Reform&rsquo;d
Religion</i>, which Heaven so <i>signally</i> rescued under Her
<i>first Royal Ancestor</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>We cannot
then let one <i>Thanksgiving</i> justle out another, when the
<i>Blessings</i> which occasion them hang, as it were, upon one
<i>Link</i>, level at the same End, and are so many successive
<i>Proofs</i> of the same kind and watchful
<i>Providence</i>.&nbsp; Those Enemies of our Faith, who
<i>formerly</i> fought to <i>undermine</i> us at Home, now
<i>forcibly attack</i> us from Abroad: So that whilst We are
remembring the successful <i>Repulse</i> of their open
<i>Assaults</i>, it cannot be unseasonable to reflect too upon
the happy <i>Defeat</i> of their <i>private</i>
Conspiracies.&nbsp; Nor can <i>Distance</i> of Time be any just
Reason, why the <i>One</i> should be forgot, when the
<i>Other</i> are celebrated, seeing the Interval cannot seem long
from the very first <i>Reformation</i>, or betwixt the Reigns of
two Glorious <i>Queens</i>, whose <i>Characters</i> come so near
each other, and do so happily resemble.</p>
<p><i>Easie</i> then it is in the general to vindicate the
<i>Honour</i> and <i>Justice</i> of celebrating this <i>Day</i>;
but &rsquo;tis as <i>difficult</i> to determine in what
particular Manner it may best be done.&nbsp; To attempt an
<i>Historical Account</i>, wou&rsquo;d be to <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>trespass upon
this judicious <i>Audience</i>, so well acquainted with the known
<i>Matter of Fact</i>: To aim at an <i>Elegant</i>
Representation, wou&rsquo;d be only to fall short of those many
Excellent <i>Pens</i> which have set the <i>Fifth of November</i>
in the best <i>Light</i> it can bear.&nbsp; For &rsquo;tis well
known, that this <i>Festival</i> fixes not more Calumny upon the
Romish <i>Clergy</i>, than it has serv&rsquo;d to shew the
<i>Oratory</i>, and advance the Credit of <i>our Own</i>: And
those Designs which rais&rsquo;d <i>Horrour</i> in the
<i>Enterprize</i>, have since produced much <i>Beauty</i> in the
<i>Description</i>.</p>
<p>To these <i>Admirable Discourses</i> upon the <i>Subject</i>,
I do pleasingly remit You;&nbsp; And shall presume only to offer
a few plain <i>Reflections</i> upon the following Words, <i>If it
had not been</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The main Observation directly <i>flowing</i> from the
<i>Text</i>, and <i>properly</i> suiting the <i>Solemnity</i> is
This: <i>viz.</i>&nbsp; That the <i>Defeat</i> of such desperate
<i>Enterprizes</i> as proceed from a devilish <i>Intention</i>,
and are not by any Humane Means to be prevented in the
<i>Execution</i>, argues the unquestionable Interposal of Divine
<i>Providence</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>The
Observation, I think, is <i>self-evident</i>; and shines by its
own Light: For if we own the Existence of a <i>Good Being</i> who
loves and preserves Us, and of an <i>Evil One</i>, who hates and
would destroy Us, where should the One declare his
<i>Providence</i>, but where the Other discovers his
<i>Malice</i>?&nbsp; And in what <i>Cases</i> can devilish
<i>Malice</i> be more visibly discover&rsquo;d, than in
<i>Those</i>, where the General Ruin of great Numbers of People
is design&rsquo;d, without any <i>Provocation</i>, and beyond all
<i>Prevention</i>?&nbsp; Or where can Divine <i>Providence</i>
more worthily appear, than in baffling those black and barbarous
<i>Attempts</i>, which at once overcome <i>Force</i>, and escapes
<i>Foresight</i>.&nbsp; Here, if ever, is an important Necessity
of <i>having the Lord on our side</i>, when an
<i>Insurrection</i> is so cruel as not to be resisted, and
<i>Destruction</i> swallows so quick as not to be remedied:&nbsp;
Two ugly <i>Characters</i> these, which sit close upon the
design&rsquo;d <i>Tragedy</i> of this Day: Insomuch that
&rsquo;tis hard to say whether the <i>Intention</i> of it was
more inhuman, or the <i>Execution</i> in all Appearance more
unavoidable.</p>
<p>First the Conspiracy was cruel and inhumane.&nbsp; And where
can we find any thing like it either under Heathen Tyrants, or
amidst <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the
ten Christian Persecutions?&nbsp; A <i>compendious</i> kind of
<i>Martyrdom</i> This, such as our <i>Church-Historians</i> say
nothing of.&nbsp; Without the Formality of Fire and a Stake for
every single Sufferer, here an entire Nation was to be sent up
for a <i>Burnt-Offering</i>, and the Body of a People to be
sacrificed at once in their <i>Representatives</i>.&nbsp; This
was a noble <i>Dispatch</i> of <i>Heresy</i>, compar&rsquo;d to
the dull <i>Proceedings</i> of <i>Queen Mary&rsquo;s</i> Reign;
and the <i>Reformation</i> now was like to vanish in a Cloud of
Smoke in one instant.&nbsp; The <i>King</i> and <i>Princes</i> of
the Blood, the <i>Lords</i> and <i>Commons</i> of <i>England</i>
were at the same Minute to find both <i>Death</i> and a
<i>Grave</i>; And upon the Ruins of one <i>Pile</i> was to be
rear&rsquo;d the Tomb of a whole <i>Kingdom</i>.&nbsp; Glorious
<i>Mischief</i>! and what might actually compleat (that which a
certain <i>Emperor</i> only ineffectually wish&rsquo;d) the
cutting off a <i>Common-wealth</i> at one Blow.</p>
<p>Must not this barbarous <i>Scene</i>, tho&rsquo; at a hundred
Years distance, move every Heart <i>entirely English</i>?&nbsp;
How does even the imaginary Slaughter of our worthy Ancestors
come cold over our Breasts, and the Blood which we draw from them
runs chill upon the Reflection.&nbsp; Had <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>they indeed
met with a fair Enemy, and heard any Warning of their Danger,
then, no doubt, their native Courage would have left Us as little
Cause of Concern, as their Adversaries or Boasting: But for
<i>Valour</i> and <i>Bravery</i> to be blown up by a
<i>scandalous Stratagem</i>, for <i>Nobility</i> and
<i>Honour</i> to be blasted by an <i>underground</i> Attempt, the
Thought raises <i>Indignation</i> and <i>Compassion</i> at
once.&nbsp; A <i>Prince</i> and the <i>Peers</i> of a
<i>Realm</i> to fall by the Hands of a vile <i>Incendiary</i>;
<i>Senators</i> and wise <i>Counsellors</i>, when studying the
common <i>Safety</i>, to sink into sudden <i>Ruin</i>; Persons of
the best <i>Quality</i> and <i>Rank</i> to be swallow&rsquo;d up
in ignominious and undistinguish&rsquo;d Dust!&nbsp; Who can hear
the bare <i>Mention</i> without a <i>Mixture</i> of Grief and
Horror?&nbsp; A <i>Parliament</i> in this dreadful manner
<i>dissolv&rsquo;d</i> could forebode no less than Universal
Confusion, and the entire Overthrow of <i>Church</i> and
<i>State</i>.</p>
<p>Let not a <i>Popish Inquisition</i>, or a <i>Parisian
Massacre</i> be any more talk&rsquo;d of: <i>Puny</i> Cruelties
these, not worthy to vie with the Wholesale <i>Execution</i> of a
<i>Community</i>: Course and common <i>Villanies</i>, much below
the <i>refin&rsquo;d</i> and <i>exquisite</i> Methods of slaying
Numbers in a Moment.&nbsp; <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Here that <i>Order</i> of Men, which
is ingenious in all the <i>Arts</i> of Ruin, did many degrees
outwit it self, and learnt a new way of <i>consecrating</i> that
sulphurous <i>Composition</i> which an Age or two before they had
invented.&nbsp; <i>Wo unto us</i>: For had the Design taken,
<i>We had been as Sodom</i>, <i>and been made like unto
Gomorra</i>: Each Destruction, as to the <i>Materials</i> of it,
was very much the same: Theirs only was <i>rain&rsquo;d</i> from
Heaven; Ours was to <i>rise</i> from the Bowels of the
Earth.&nbsp; Perhaps it might have, in the Conclusion, been more
tolerable for <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorra</i> than for Us: Just
so much, as &rsquo;tis better to fall into the Hands of a
merciful <i>God</i>, than into Those of Bigotted and
Blood-thirsty Men.</p>
<p>Moreover, What upon the Principles of the Romish <i>Church</i>
must add the finishing Stroke to the <i>cruel</i> Fact, was, the
downright sending so many guilty Souls into Hell without any Room
for <i>Repentance</i>, or Possibility of <i>Redemption</i>.&nbsp;
There could be no <i>Purgatory</i> to cleanse Them, unless the
<i>Flames</i> they were immediately to pass thro&rsquo; could
attain that Effect.&nbsp; No <i>Masses</i> to be said for
<i>Hereticks</i>: Those were more worthily reserv&rsquo;d for the
<i>Chief Promoters</i> of <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>this <i>Catholick Cause</i>,
supposing they should by any means miscarry in it.&nbsp; The
<i>Actors</i> in this horrid <i>Scene</i> had pardon and
Indulgence ready, if not the Promise of being
<i>Canoniz&rsquo;d</i>; But the poor Sufferers were to perish
under a <i>Curse</i>, and, as if Death was not enough to expiate
their <i>Heresie</i>, an <i>Anathema</i> too must attend them
into the other World.&nbsp; Hard Fate! when the Errors of unhappy
<i>Protestants</i> are not to be dispersed with their Ashes, but
<i>Excommunications</i> and <i>Interdicts</i> must still pursue
them into a miserable Eternity.</p>
<p>The Warmth of this Resentment can want no <i>Apology</i>, when
we consider farther that no ill <i>Usage</i> before-hand gave the
least Colour to this unnatural <i>Conspiracy</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Subjects</i> they were, who thus undutifully aim&rsquo;d at
the Life of their <i>Sovereign</i>; And Subjects too very
tenderly treated, who quietly enjoyed their <i>Liberties</i> and
<i>Estates</i>, and had no Occasion to make them uneasie, but the
clearing of the same <i>Faith</i> from <i>additional</i>
Superstitions, which in <i>Substance</i> we jointly
believe.&nbsp; Was it fair to destroy their lawful <i>Prince</i>,
because they were rid of a <i>Supremacy</i> which made them meer
<i>Slaves</i>?&nbsp; Was it just to overturn the antient
<i>Constitution</i>, <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>because rescued from a
<i>Discipline</i>, which, if blindly followed, treats them like
<i>Fools</i>?&nbsp; Or if they were still so much in Love with
the Usurpations of the <i>Popedom</i>, could not they be content
to bear the galling <i>Yoke</i> themselves, without compelling
others into the same <i>Bondage</i>?&nbsp; And compelling them
too in such a savage manner, that the Best of the <i>Kingdom</i>
must be kill&rsquo;d outright, in Order to enthral the
Rest.&nbsp; Their Consciences were full in their own
<i>keeping</i>, or in that of their <i>Confessors</i>; and their
usual Violences were not practis&rsquo;d, tho&rsquo; to bring
them over to a purer <i>Communion</i>: Sure then &rsquo;twas
better for them to enjoy their <i>Religion</i> in private, and be
peaceable, than to let it come abroad to the Ruin of the
<i>Publick</i>.&nbsp; We do not find the <i>Romish
Missionaries</i> are generally so forward as to propagate their
Faith Abroad, where there is a Hazard of dying for it: But at
Home, where They may profess it without Disturbance, the Death of
their own <i>Countrymen</i> is not stuck at to make way for its
general Reception.</p>
<p>To advance only one Step farther: Let us grant <i>Popery</i>
for once to be as pure and <i>Primitive</i>, as its most zealous
Votaries contend, <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>and as <i>Catholick</i> too as they could wish to have
it; yet it makes the Argument still more guiltily recoil, to
carry on a <i>holy</i> Cause by impious <i>Projects</i>, and to
promote a <i>merciful</i> Religion by <i>inhumane</i>
Practices.&nbsp; Lord! how did it ever enter into the Hearts of
<i>Christians</i>, that a kind Religion which heaps Coals of Fire
upon the Heads of Enemies, should do This not in a <i>moral</i>
Sense to melt and soften, but in a <i>natural</i> One to burn and
consume.&nbsp; The Spirit of <i>Jesus</i> is distinguishable by
its ingenuous <i>Simplicity</i>: Greater Shame, that <i>Those</i>
who emphatically stile themselves His <i>Order</i>, should be
famous for pernicious <i>Subtlety</i>, and fatal
<i>Intrigue</i>!&nbsp; How comes the <i>Propagation</i> of the
Gospel to be a perfect Contradiction to its <i>Precepts</i>, the
latter <i>enjoining</i> whatever is good and benign, the former
<i>authorising</i> whatever is cruel and destructive?&nbsp; A
strange Way of converting either <i>Infidels</i> or
<i>Hereticks</i>, when the Doctrine of Christ is directly
overturn&rsquo;d in the manner of the <i>Publication</i>.&nbsp;
Upon all these Accounts, and under all these Views such a
<i>complicated Cruelty</i> is not to be met with in <i>Story</i>;
and to dwell longer upon it would be apt only to raise too much
<i>Heat</i>, and run us upon the Hazard of losing
<i>Temper</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>2<i>ndly</i>, The <i>Conspiracy</i> was to all
appearance as <i>certain</i> in Execution as in Intention,
<i>cruel</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Seat</i> of this clandestine
Wickedness was dark and obscure, as far remov&rsquo;d from any
mortal <i>Eye</i>, as one would have thought the Mischief it self
was from Humane <i>Invention</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Situation</i> of
the Place, as well as <i>Nature</i> of the Fact, shew&rsquo;d
that it came too near the Dominions of the <i>Prince</i> of
<i>Darkness</i>: And He sure was too well pleased with the
Infernal <i>Plot</i> ever to give us the least Intimation.&nbsp;
More likely it was the <i>Evil Angels</i> should be Ministers and
Accomplices, than Betrayers and Divulgers of the <i>Hellish
Deed</i>, too bad sure ever to be begun without their
<i>Instigation</i>, or to be accomplish&rsquo;d without their
<i>Assistance</i>.&nbsp; In one Sense truly this <i>Pit</i> which
They had digg&rsquo;d for Us was unlike the <i>Bottomless
One</i>: The Access to it was difficult, the Avenue narrow, and
hard it was to find the Way down to <i>these Chambers of
Death</i>:&nbsp; But, in another Respect it resembled it too
much, namely, that being once sunk into the <i>sad Abyss</i>,
there could be no Hope of Return.&nbsp; How then must the secret
<i>Villany</i> but needs succeed, which no prying <i>Sagacity</i>
could discover, and from which <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>no appearing <i>Strength</i> deliver
Us?&nbsp; What Arbitrary Power <i>above</i> a <i>Parliament</i>
was ever so dangerous, as this insidious Design which in another
Sense lay <i>beneath</i> It?</p>
<p>The <i>immediate Agents</i> were not more cunning in the
Contrivance, than obstinate in the Concealment.&nbsp; For
apprehending (as truly they had Cause enough) that Nature would
shrink at the <i>forbidding Fact</i>, and Humanity not be able to
hold out, they thought no Course so sure as fulfilling this
Morning&rsquo;s <i>second Lesson</i>, and binding themselves
(like the Way-layers of St. <i>Paul</i>) under Oath and
Imprecation.&nbsp; Religion was speciously call&rsquo;d in to
back the accurs&rsquo;d <i>Confederacy</i>, to stifle the faint
Motions of Compassion or Conscience, and to gloss over a Crime
too gross to go down, if not <i>superficially sanctified</i>: And
(what is Ill beyond all Epithets) the <i>Holy Sacrament</i> was
made the Test of the Treason, and the sacred Seal of the New
<i>Covenant</i> of <i>Grace</i> made to confirm <i>One</i> of
Treachery and <i>Malice</i>.&nbsp; If we count it so bad to
prostitute this <i>Institution</i>, even for a <i>temporal</i>
Preferment; What must it be to make it jointly the Cement, and
the Cover of such an <i>Infernal</i> Machination?&nbsp; No <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Thought then
but the fatal <i>Train</i> must take, when the Mouths of the
wicked <i>Associates</i> were as cautiously stopp&rsquo;d, as the
very Passages tending down into the dark <i>Apartment</i> it
self.&nbsp; So far were the <i>Conspirators</i> from any Fear of
<i>Detection</i>, that they hugg&rsquo;d themselves over it, as a
finish&rsquo;d Work: So far from any Purpose of
<i>Confession</i>, that they bless&rsquo;d themselves for it, as
a brave Achievement.&nbsp; The Sense of <i>Punishment</i>, even
when the Affair had miscarried, could extort no Discovery; much
less could <i>Pity</i>, or any other <i>Principle</i> do it,
whilst it was in Agitation.&nbsp; To this Day We do not find They
are asham&rsquo;d of the Thing, or afflicted at any Part of it,
bating the <i>Disappointment</i>.&nbsp; The Picture of an
<i>English Jesuit</i>, who was principally concern&rsquo;d in it,
is now shown at <i>Rome</i> among the <i>Rarities</i> of the
<i>Place</i>, and preserved there as a venerable <i>Relique</i>:
This looks like recommending the Crime to Posterity, and facing
the present <i>Solemnity</i> out of Countenance.&nbsp; This tells
us that if more such <i>Champions</i> for the <i>Romish See</i>
are to be met with, their Merits shall not go unrewarded: And
consequently, what Cause <i>We</i> have to be still upon our
Guard, and to keep up the <i>Anniversary Memorial</i>, not only
by way of <i>Thankfulness</i> <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>for what is past, but of
<i>Warning</i> too for the future.</p>
<p>No Danger could insensibly be nearer the very Act and Minute
of Accomplishment.&nbsp; The whole <i>Scheme</i> was laid; The
gloomy <i>Theatre</i> prepar&rsquo;d; The fatal <i>Materials</i>
ready; The <i>Undertakers</i> resolute; The <i>nick</i> of Time
at Hand, and nothing but a thin <i>Partition</i> betwixt the
Regions of Light and Darkness, of Life and Death.&nbsp; Upon firm
<i>Ground</i> we seemingly stood, not dreaming that without a
Parable, <i>There was a great Gulf fixed</i>, and We inevitably
to perish in it, unless some kind Messenger from the other World
would inform us of the Hazard.&nbsp; The granting of that
<i>deny&rsquo;d</i> Petition seem&rsquo;d now the only
<i>Expedient</i> of our Rescue.&nbsp; How <i>slender</i> a
<i>Support</i> at that Minute had the Fate and Felicity of
<i>England</i>?&nbsp; Upon how <i>slight</i> a <i>Bottom</i> was
our Hope and Happiness founded?&nbsp; A small <i>Surface</i> of
Earth, the <i>Space</i> of a few Hours was all that Mediated
betwixt us and Ruin: Then by a <i>Fate</i> not unlike to
<i>Corah</i> and his <i>Company</i>, was the Earth to open and
devour Us, tho&rsquo; (thank God) for no <i>Fault</i> of the same
Nature.&nbsp; If to every <i>Nation</i> there be, as some have
thought, its <i>adverse</i>, and its <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span><i>tutelary Angel</i>, we cannot
doubt but the utmost Contest was betwixt <i>Them</i> at this
critical <i>Period</i>; The One <i>eager</i> to push on our
impending Overthrow, the Other as <i>Industrious</i> to prevent
it.</p>
<p>No: What do we talk of <i>Tutelary Angels</i>?&nbsp; <i>If the
Lord Himself had not been on our side</i>, <i>They had swallowed
Us up quick</i>: To frustrate an Intention so cruel, and an
Execution so certain, was <i>something</i> sure which
<i>wanted</i> immediate <i>Providence</i>, and <i>worthy</i> of
it also.&nbsp; To save a whole <i>Community</i>, when upon the
Brink of Peril, as little appriz&rsquo;d of it, as they gave
their Enemies Occasion to design it: To catch <i>Conspirators</i>
in the Snares of their own <i>Policy</i>, and to plunge them into
the <i>Pit</i> which they had prepar&rsquo;d for Others: To guide
inconsiderable <i>Causes</i> to the producing of wondrous good
Effects, and to make accidental <i>Hints</i> the Means of mighty
<i>Preservations</i>: All these, and many more Particulars of
<i>this Day</i>, are plain Instances of Divine Interposal.&nbsp;
Strange it was that such a Relenting <i>Message</i> should be
sent at all, when the <i>Conspirators</i> were so hardened in
<i>Bigotry</i>, and bandied together upon <i>Principle</i>!&nbsp;
Stranger still that it should be so <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>fortunately <i>misconvey&rsquo;d</i>
and come to a <i>Person</i> for whom it was not meant!&nbsp;
Strangest of all, that being writ in such blind and ambiguous
<i>Terms</i>, it should be so speedily and seasonably
explained!</p>
<p>So many concurring <i>Circumstances</i>, when meeting in such
a Momentous <i>Point</i>, cannot fairly be resolved into
<i>Chance</i>, one of which had no manner of <i>Coherence</i>
with the Other.&nbsp; How should the <i>King</i>, without some
Glance of extraordinary <i>Light</i>, pierce into the horrid
<i>Vault</i>, the hidden Store-house of Destruction?&nbsp; How
without some Touch of a Prophetick <i>Spirit</i> should He ever
think of that fatal <i>One</i> that was to blow up both the
<i>Houses</i> of <i>Parliament</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Conjecture</i>
at first Hearing must appear as <i>ridiculous</i>, as the
<i>Fact</i> it self was <i>barbarous</i>; And the <i>Wit</i> of
Man seem&rsquo;d as incapable of hitting upon the <i>One</i>, as
his <i>Malice</i> of committing the <i>Other</i>.&nbsp; But the
less the natural <i>Likelihood</i> was, the greater was the
Providential <i>Appearance</i>; And what might be laught at under
the Notion of a <i>Humane</i> Guess, upon the Proof of the Thing
we adore the more as <i>Divine</i> Discovery.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Never
sure shall we cease to Adore the <i>Great Author</i> of our
unexpected Safety, who rescued us at once from the <i>Fiery
Furnace</i>, and from the <i>devouring Den</i>: Those Punishments
which <i>Old Babylon</i> distinctly inflicted, the <i>New</i> had
join&rsquo;d together, as it were in One.&nbsp; How unwillingly
were the base Workers of Iniquity expos&rsquo;d to open
<i>Day</i>, unable to bear it, because <i>their Deeds were
reproved</i>?&nbsp; How happily did <i>We</i> escape the
perpetual <i>Night</i> in which they sought to overwhelm
Us?&nbsp; Loth were They to quit their private <i>Cell</i>
wherein they labour&rsquo;d for our Overthrow, as the Miner for
his Oar, and counted our Ruin their <i>Riches</i>.&nbsp; But
<i>Heaven</i> sent a sudden <i>Damp</i> upon their Designs, and
the Weapons which they had formed in this <i>Hellish Forge</i>
would not prosper.</p>
<p>So far was <i>God</i> from giving us up unto Destruction, that
he suffer&rsquo;d us not so much as to fear It, but
scatter&rsquo;d both the <i>Fear</i> and <i>Destruction</i> at
once.&nbsp; No <i>Peril</i> was ever more imminent, and yet our
Deliverance scarce put Us to the Expence of a <i>Fright</i>; And
without Time for being troubled, We saw our <i>Danger</i>, and
gave our <i>Thanks</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Plot</i> was just perfected
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>to the
clear <i>Conviction</i> and Condemnation of our Enemies; And yet
conceal&rsquo;d from Us, till &rsquo;twas prevented, that We
might labour under no <i>Confusion</i>.&nbsp; Astonishing
<i>Wisdom</i>! which knows how to let the <i>Wicked</i> prosper
for a while, and yet at the same Time not to perplex the
<i>Good</i>: So that in the Event the One may be more
<i>justly</i> punish&rsquo;d, the Other more <i>surprisingly</i>
saved.</p>
<p>We have yet taken but a Half-view of this Happy
<i>Day</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis famous for a <i>second
Deliverance</i> of later Date, tho&rsquo; very much of the same
kind.&nbsp; The <i>Adversaries</i> the same, the <i>Hazard</i> as
great, and the <i>Escape</i> at that Juncture not less
welcom.&nbsp; <i>One</i> serves to heighten and advance the
<i>Other</i>, tho&rsquo; each of them singly stands above
Acknowledgment.&nbsp; They both have a like Place in the
<i>Offices</i> of the <i>Church</i>, and equally adorn its
<i>Calendar</i>.&nbsp; To give as particular Relation of
<i>This</i>, as of the <i>Former</i>, would be both Unnecessary
and Indecent: <i>Unnecessary</i>, as copying only what is writ in
your own Memory: <i>Indecent</i>, as seeming to call your
Gratitude into Question.</p>
<p>Few here present have forgot the dreadful <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Apprehensions
of approaching <i>Popery</i>: Not twenty Years are turn&rsquo;d,
since <i>Liberty</i> and <i>Religion</i>, the two great Blessings
of Humane Life, were taking their flight from this melancholy
<i>Island</i>.&nbsp; Unhappy <i>Britain</i> was putting on Her
Chains, lay sunk and dispirited, fighting for <i>Relief</i>, but
saw it not.&nbsp; That <i>Church</i> which is the Bulwark of the
<i>Reformation</i>, was Her self defenceless; And <i>She</i> to
whom her <i>Sister-Churches</i> fled for Refuge, thought of
seeking the same favour, and could no where find it.&nbsp; Our
<i>Ark</i> was actually tottering, and no one could put his Hand
forth to uphold it, without feeling <i>Uzziah&rsquo;s</i> Fate:
Not inflicted indeed for the same unwarrantable <i>Cause</i>, but
equal to it in the <i>Certainty</i> of the Danger.&nbsp; We could
not tell how soon our <i>Bibles</i> might be shut, and our
<i>Temples</i>.&nbsp; It was already common with us to offer up
our <i>Prayers</i> in an <i>unknown Language</i>, that I mean
wherein we privately begg&rsquo;d of God to defend his poor
<i>Church</i>, but durst let none hear Us but our selves.&nbsp;
The Fountains of <i>Education</i> were insensibly corrupted: What
follow&rsquo;d was no <i>Knowledge</i> at all, and
<i>Superstition</i> in lieu of it.&nbsp; The <i>Host</i> was
daily expected in our Streets, the next was <i>Flame</i> and
<i>Faggot</i> for not adoring it.&nbsp; I <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>appeal to the
dejected Looks, and down cast Eyes of every true
<i>Protestant</i> at that Time, if it was not Thus.&nbsp; No
Glimpse of Assistance all this while from <i>Heaven</i>, or any
<i>Humane</i> Power.&nbsp; The former seem&rsquo;d <i>angry</i>;
The latter was <i>impotent</i>, and could not help Us.</p>
<p>Thus was <i>Darkness</i> and <i>Despair</i> spread over the
Face of the whole <i>Kingdom</i>, till an <i>Invited Prince</i>
rose from the <i>East</i>, and rejoiced with the Sun to begin his
Course.&nbsp; We saw Him, as upon this <i>Day</i>, appearing with
feeble Rays, with few <i>Forces</i>, attended tho&rsquo; with
united <i>Wishes</i>.&nbsp; His <i>Coming</i> was not with a
<i>killing</i> Lustre, or with a Glory that <i>destroys</i>,
whilst it <i>shines</i>; But all Folks then were refresh&rsquo;d
with the pleasing Sight, and felt a strange Revival.&nbsp; By his
Presence He caus&rsquo;d an <i>Effusion</i> of <i>Joy</i>, but
none of <i>Christian Blood</i>.&nbsp; The farther he
advanc&rsquo;d, his <i>Influence</i> was found the more
agreeable.&nbsp; <i>Slavery</i> and <i>Idolatry</i> instantly
vanish&rsquo;d, and the Shades of <i>Superstition</i> fled before
Him.&nbsp; The <i>Emissaries</i> of <i>Rome</i>, those Creatures
of Prey, got them away together, and laid them down in their
Dens.&nbsp; Into Holes and Corners they retir&rsquo;d, haunted by
the Guilt of their ill <i>Counsels</i>, and as forward <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>to desert an
<i>unhappy Prince</i>, as formerly they had been to Mislead
Him.&nbsp; We, in the mean Time, wrapt up in <i>Silence</i> and
in <i>Wonder</i>, where wholly like to them that Dream.&nbsp; To
us the <i>Deliverance</i> seem&rsquo;d meer <i>Vision</i>, and
the Surprize into which it cast Us, would scarce allow us to
think it <i>Real</i>.&nbsp; Our <i>Rescue</i> was well nigh over,
as soon as undertook, and we lifted up our <i>Heads</i> to see a
Safety obtained, in which our <i>Hands</i> had no share.&nbsp;
The only <i>Difficulty</i> We were then left under was how to
prize and honour our <i>Deliverer</i> enough.&nbsp; We
judg&rsquo;d it as impossible ever to be unthankful for the
seasonable <i>Relief</i>, as once it seem&rsquo;d so, ever to
obtain it; And we could repine at nothing (how much soever We
have done it since) but at our own <i>Inability</i>, justly to
acknowledge so great an <i>Undertaking</i>.</p>
<p>May this Auspicious <i>Day</i> ever bear a bright Figure in
the <i>English Annals</i>, and continue, as it always has been,
the Ornament of <i>History</i>, and Shame of <i>Popery</i>.&nbsp;
May the glad <i>Celebration</i> of it run down to late Posterity,
and so keep those Blessings upon perpetual Record, which
otherwise, as at <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>present they are too big to be own&rsquo;d; so in an Age
or two would seem too great to be believ&rsquo;d.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis but fitting the <i>Church</i> should observe a
<i>Festival</i>, from which she dates her double Preservation;
And we cannot fairly grudge the Day a Share in her Service, when
without it the Whole had been lost.&nbsp; It has in former Time
been thought, that the Conjunction of Stars made some Days
particularly successful to Persons, or Nations: But our Faith
upon this Occasion carries Us above Those, and puts us under a
higher and a better Aspect; namely, that of a wise and benign
Providence.&nbsp; Heaven will not allow us to be ungrateful, when
we are thus critically and opportunely reminded, twice I mean on
one Day.&nbsp; This confirm&rsquo;d Experience gives us cause
enough to conclude with the last Words of this Psalm: <i>Our Help
standeth in the Name of the Lord</i>, <i>who hath made Heaven and
Earth</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
